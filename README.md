# MLOPs: Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to understand how **student performance** is affected by factors such as:
- **Gender**
- **Ethnicity**
- **Parental level of education**
- **Lunch type**
- **Test preparation course**

The goal is to identify key drivers of academic success and build predictive models to inform educational interventions.

## Problem Statement
The project investigates the impact of these factors on student performance, focusing on metrics like math, reading, and writing scores. By analyzing these variables, we can better understand which factors most significantly influence academic outcomes.

## Approach
### 1. **Data Analysis**
- **Dataset**: The project uses a structured dataset containing student information and performance metrics. While the specific dataset isn't named here, it typically includes variables such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and participation in test preparation courses.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The code includes visualizations and statistical tests to uncover correlations between these factors and student performance.

### 2. **Methodology**
- **Feature Engineering**: Categorical variables are encoded to prepare them for modeling (e.g., `lunch` â†’ `free/reduced` vs. `standard`).
- **Model Building**: Regression or classification models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) are used to predict scores based on input features.
- **Interpretability**: Tools like SHAP or feature importance scores help explain model decisions.

### 3. **Code Review**
 
- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Handles missing values, normalizes scores, and encodes categorical variables.
- **`train_model.py`**: Implements model pipelines with hyperparameter tuning (e.g., `GridSearchCV`).
- **`visualization.ipynb`**: Generates plots (e.g., boxplots of scores by parental education) to highlight trends.

## Key Steps in Solving the Problem
1. **Identify Impactful Factors**:  
   - Code analyzes metrics like mean scores across groups (e.g., students with/without test prep).
   - Statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) validate the significance of differences.

2. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Models quantify how each factor contributes to performance (e.g., coefficients in regression).

3. **Actionable Insights**:  
   - Recommends interventions (e.g., expanding test prep access) based on findings.
